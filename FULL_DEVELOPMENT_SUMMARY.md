### 4. Book System Integration
**Enhancements**:
- Non-destructive workflows for missing media
- Improved page mapping dialog
- Better 3D book visualization
- Canonical Book JSON structure implementation

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "pages": [{"id": "string", "name": "string", "url": "string"}],
  "volumeMetadata": {"pageCount": "number", "coverMaterial": "string"}
}
```

### 5. Storage and Persistence
**Implementation**:
- Dexie (IndexedDB) integration for local storage
- Project save/load functionality
- JSON export/import with full state preservation
- Placeholder system for missing media files

  - `freeGridItemsAtom` - Free canvas items
  - `atomPagesAtom` - Book organization
  - `annotationsAtom` - Vector drawings

### Performance Optimizations
- Web Workers for thumbnail generation
- React-window for list virtualization
- Debounced expensive operations
- Texture preloading for 3D views

### Data Flow Improvements
- Consistent data structures across components
- Proper prop drilling prevention with Jotai
- Event handler optimization with useCallback
- Memoization of expensive calculations

## Bug Fixes and Stability

### Critical Fixes
1. **Memory Management**:
   - Proper cleanup of event listeners
   - Ref management for drag operations
   - State update batching

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation for missing media
   - JSON validation for imports
   - Fallback rendering for failed loads

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
   - SVG rendering consistency
   - Transform calculation fixes
   - Event handling normalization

### Known Issues Resolved
- Vector paths not selectable
- Pencil strokes disappearing on selection
