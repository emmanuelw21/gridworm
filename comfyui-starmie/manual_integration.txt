# Manual Integration for ComfyUI server.py

If the automatic installation doesn't work, add this to your ComfyUI's server.py file:

## Step 1: Find where the PromptServer is created
Look for a line like:
```python
server = server.PromptServer(loop)
```

## Step 2: Add after server creation
Add this code block after the server is created but before it starts:

```python
# Starmie Integration
try:
    import sys
    import os
    # Add custom_nodes to path if not already there
    custom_nodes_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "custom_nodes")
    if custom_nodes_path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(custom_nodes_path)
    
    # Import and setup Starmie
    from comfyui_starmie.starmie_integration import setup_starmie_routes
    setup_starmie_routes(server)
    print("âœ¨ Starmie integration loaded successfully")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Starmie not found in custom_nodes: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to load Starmie integration: {e}")
```

## Step 3: Save and restart ComfyUI

The endpoints should now be available at:
- http://localhost:8188/starmie/manifest
- http://localhost:8188/starmie/star
- http://localhost:8188/starmie/file/{item_id}
- ws://localhost:8188/starmie (WebSocket)
