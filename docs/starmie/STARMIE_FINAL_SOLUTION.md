# Final Solution for Starmie Installation

The issue is that ComfyUI loads the extension but doesn't register the HTTP routes. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Update and Restart (Try This First)

1. **Copy these new files** to `C:\Users\emman\Documents\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\comfyui-starmie\`:
   - `api.py`
   - `routes.py` 
   - `server_extension.py`
   - Updated `__init__.py`

2. **Restart ComfyUI** and watch for `[Starmie]` messages

3. **Test** by visiting: http://127.0.0.1:8000/starmie/test

## Option 2: Manual Installation (If Option 1 Fails)

1. **Open Command Prompt** in your ComfyUI directory:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\emman\Documents\ComfyUI
   ```

2. **Run the manual installer**:
   ```
   python custom_nodes\comfyui-starmie\install_manually.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** and restart ComfyUI

## Option 3: Direct Server Modification (Last Resort)

1. **Find** `server.py` or `main.py` in your ComfyUI folder

2. **Add this code** right before the server starts (before `server.start()` or similar):
   ```python
   # Starmie Integration
   try:
       from custom_nodes.comfyui_starmie import api
       print("Starmie routes loaded")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Failed to load Starmie: {e}")
   ```

## Why This Happens

- ComfyUI desktop app might handle custom node routes differently
- The 404 error confirms routes aren't being registered
- Different ComfyUI versions use different methods for adding routes

## Testing

After any of these methods, test with:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/starmie/test
```

Should return: `{"status": "ok", "message": "Starmie is working!"}`

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Gridworm detects ComfyUI on port 8000
- ‚úÖ CORS is enabled
- ‚ùå Routes aren't registered (404 error)
- üîß Need to manually register routes
