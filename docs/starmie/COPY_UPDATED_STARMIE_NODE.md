# Copy Updated Starmie Node

The error you got shows that the StarmieNode was trying to move a file that didn't exist yet. I've fixed this by:

1. **Actually saving the image** instead of just trying to move a non-existent file
2. **Converting the tensor to a PIL image** properly
3. **Adding index to filenames** to avoid collisions in batch processing
4. **Saving directly to the destination** instead of save-then-move

## To Fix:

Copy the updated `starmie_node.py` to your ComfyUI installation:
```
C:\Users\emman\Documents\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\comfyui-starmie\starmie_node.py
```

## What Changed:

The node now:
- Properly converts ComfyUI's tensor format to PIL images
- Saves images directly to either `output` or `selected-output` folder
- Handles batch processing with indexed filenames
- Returns proper UI data for ComfyUI

## After Copying:

1. Restart ComfyUI
2. Run your workflow again
3. The error should be gone and images should save to `selected-output` folder

## Verification:

Check for a `selected-output` folder in your ComfyUI directory after running - it should contain the starred images and a `.starmie-manifest.json` file.

## Note:

This also confirms the StarmieNode is loading and working in ComfyUI! The HTTP routes issue is separate - the node functionality works even without the routes.
