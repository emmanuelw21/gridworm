## 1. Mixed Selection Dragging Fix
**Issue**: Users could multi-select both vectors and media objects, but couldn't move them together as a group.

**Solution**: 
- Unified the drag handling system to use consistent offset calculations for both vector and media items
- Added `draggedMediaPositionsRef` to store initial positions for media items
- Updated mouse handlers to calculate movement delta from the same reference point

**Result**: Mixed selections of vectors and media items now move together smoothly without spreading apart.

## 2. Pencil Tool Improvements

### 2.1 Stroke Width Scaling Issue
**Issue**: Pencil strokes were creating massive blobs regardless of the stroke width setting.

**Solution**:
- Added `vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke"` to all path elements
- Fixed the stroke width property mapping (was overwriting `width` with bounding box width)
- Updated stroke width slider:
  - Range: 0.5 to 5 (previously 1 to 10)
  - Step: 0.5 increments
  - Added visual feedback showing current stroke width value
  - Default: 1px (previously 2px)

### 2.2 Pencil Stroke Selection
**Issue**: Pencil strokes were not selectable.

**Solution**:
- Added proper hit detection for pencil paths using bounding box checks
- Enabled pointer events on SVG elements when in select mode
- Added onClick handlers for single and multi-selection (Ctrl/Cmd)
- Fixed the disappearing issue when selected by:
  - Properly storing original path data as array
  - Handling both pencil (array of strings) and vector pen (single string) formats
  - Adding safety checks for path rendering

### 2.3 Pencil Alignment Support
**Issue**: Pencil strokes didn't work with alignment tools.

**Solution**:
- Updated alignment calculations to use `boundingWidth`/`boundingHeight` for proper dimensions
- Added path coordinate transformation during alignment operations
- Ensured pencil paths are included in all alignment operations

---

## 3. Eraser Tool Fix
**Issue**: Eraser tool was not working due to a reference error.

**Solution**:
- Fixed "ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'eraseAtPosition' before initialization"
- Removed duplicate function definition
- Properly organized function declarations

---

## 4. Vector Pen Tool Improvements

### 4.1 Path Closing
**Issue**: Vector pen tool path closing was unreliable and not intuitive.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `anchor.point` undefined error by correcting data structure
- Increased snap distance from 15-20 to 20-30 pixels for easier closing
- Added visual feedback:
  - First anchor becomes larger and highlighted when closeable
  - Smooth hover transitions
  - Direct click handler on first anchor for immediate closing
- Prioritized first anchor click detection over other anchors

### 4.2 Vector Path Selection and Movement
**Issue**: Closed vector pen paths were not selectable or movable.

**Solution**:
- Converted bezier paths to use the standard annotation system
- Added 'bezier' type to hit detection logic
- Fixed path coordinate transformation during dragging
- Resolved offset issues by storing and transforming from original path data

---

## 5. Selection Enhancements

### 5.1 Marquee Selection for All Vector Types
**Issue**: Marquee selection didn't work for all vector types.

**Solution**:
- Updated marquee selection to properly detect path type annotations
- Fixed bounding box calculations for pencil and vector pen paths
- Ensured all vector types (rectangles, ellipses, polygons, paths) are included

### 5.2 Select All (Ctrl+A)
**Issue**: Ctrl+A only selected media items, not vectors.

**Solution**:
- Extended Ctrl+A functionality to select:
  - All unlocked media items
  - All vector items (annotations, shapes, paths, text)
- Ensured alignment tools work with full selections

---

## 6. Keyboard Shortcuts Fix
**Issue**: Vector toolbar hotkeys were not working consistently.

**Solution**:
- Fixed 'B' key to activate 'pencil' tool (was incorrectly set to 'pen')
- Ensured all tool shortcuts work as expected:
  - V: Select
  - B: Pencil
  - P: Vector Pen
  - R: Rectangle
  - O: Ellipse (Circle)
  - G: Polygon
  - T: Text
  - E: Eraser
  - I: Eyedropper
  - K: Paint Bucket

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `/src/components/FreeGrid/FreeGridCanvas.jsx` - Main canvas component with all fixes
- `/src/components/FreeGrid/VectorPenTool.jsx` - Vector pen tool improvements

### Data Structure Updates
- Pencil paths: Store as array of strings `["M x y", "L x y", ...]`
- Vector pen paths: Store as single string in array `["M x y C x1 y1, x2 y2, x3 y3"]`
- Added `boundingWidth`/`boundingHeight` properties for accurate hit detection
- Store original path data during drag operations for proper transformation

### Performance Considerations
- All path transformations use the original stored data to prevent cumulative errors
- Vector effects properly applied to prevent stroke scaling issues
- Efficient hit detection using bounding boxes before complex path calculations

## 7. Performance Mode (3D Viewport)
**Purpose**: Provides real performance optimizations for lower-end devices or complex scenes.

**What it does**:
- **Texture Optimization**:
  - Limits texture size to 1024x1024 pixels (automatically downscales larger images)
  - Uses NearestFilter instead of LinearFilter for texture filtering (less GPU intensive)
- **Rendering Settings**:
  - Disables antialiasing for better performance
  - Sets power preference to "low-power" instead of "high-performance"
  - Uses pixel ratio of 1 instead of device pixel ratio (reduces resolution on high-DPI displays)
  - Disables shadows completely
  - Uses basic shadow mapping instead of PCF soft shadows
- **Frame Rate**:
  - Sets target FPS to 30 instead of 60
- **Video Textures**:
  - Uses nearest neighbor filtering for video textures (less smooth but faster)

**When to use**: Enable performance mode when experiencing lag, working with many high-resolution images, using older hardware, or having many objects in the scene.

## 8. 3D Viewport Enhancements

### 8.1 Transform Panel Improvements
**Issue**: Transform panel had poor dragging behavior and overlapped the 3D viewport by default.

**Solution**:
- Changed from fixed to absolute positioning
- Set default position to upper left (16px, 16px) within viewport bounds
- Improved dragging smoothness by removing transitions/dampening
- Made it dockable by default

### 8.2 Responsive Button Layout
**Issue**: 3D viewport buttons were cropped when browser window was resized.

**Solution**:
- Added window resize event listener to track viewport width
- Implemented progressive button hiding based on viewport width:
  - < 768px: Hide auto-arrange button
  - < 1024px: Hide lighting and layers panels
  - < 1280px: Hide resource monitor
- Added "More" menu for overflow items
- Buttons now reflow properly when window is resized

### 8.3 Multi-Object Transformations
**Issue**: Could select multiple objects but only move them - rotate and scale didn't work.

**Solution**:
- Added custom gizmo classes (TranslateGizmo, RotateGizmo, ScaleGizmo) for multi-selection
- Implemented proper state management with dragStartPositions, dragStartRotations, dragStartScales refs
- Fixed rotation to use initial center point and rotation matrix
- Fixed scaling to use mouse delta and scale from initial center
- Gizmo automatically switches based on transform mode (W/E/R keys)

**Technical Details**:
- Multi-object rotation: Objects rotate around their collective center while maintaining relative positions
- Multi-object scaling: Objects scale from collective center, maintaining relative distances
- Transform modes properly update visual gizmo for immediate feedback - best to use the hotkeys

### 8.4 Scene Persistence
**Issue**: Media items were not preserved when closing/reopening the 3D viewport.

**Solution**:
- Added persistentSceneData ref to store objects, groups, and lights
- Scene restoration happens automatically when viewport is reopened
- Cleanup function preserves persistent data instead of clearing it
- **Note**: Objects do NOT maintain positions when viewport is closed/reopened

## 8. Layer System Implementation

### Complete Layer Panel (LayerPanelV2)
- Each item (media, vector, text) is now its own layer with individual controls
- Drag-to-reorder functionality for z-index management
- Type filters act as global filters, not layers themselves
- Photoshop-style locking (locked items are completely unselectable)
- Delete functionality for each layer
- Active layer selection highlights corresponding item in canvas

### Dockable Panels
- Layer panel and vector toolbar can dock to main toolbar
- Visual feedback when docking is available
- Both panels start docked by default for cleaner UI
- Collapsed state maintained when docked

---

## 9. UI/UX Improvements

### Icon Updates
- Vector toolbar icon changed from ToolCase to Wrench for better visual flow
- Improved icon consistency across the application

### Thumbnail System
- **Automatic default thumbnails** render for all media types
- No manual generation required for basic thumbnails
- Custom thumbnail generation still fully supported with live preview
- Proper thumbnail handling in all views
