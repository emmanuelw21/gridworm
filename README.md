## ‚≠ê Starmie - ComfyUI Integration

Seamlessly bridge GridWorm with ComfyUI for AI-powered image generation and processing workflows.

### **Direct ComfyUI Connection
- **Real-Time Workflow Integration**: 
  - Import generated media as they're created
  - Maintain full resolution and metadata
- **Smart Import Options**:
  - Import all images from a workflow
  - Select specific images to import
  - Preserve ComfyUI metadata for traceability
- **Zero Configuration**: Automatically detects local ComfyUI instances

### How to Use with ComfyUI:

1. **Before Starting ComfyUI**:
   - Open the Gridworm root folder and Copy and paste the comfyui-starmie folder into your ~\ComfyUI\custom_nodes folder -- you only need to do this once
   - From the same Gridworm root folder, navigate to the starmie-bridge folder and run the start_bridge_polling.bat file (this initiated the Starmie "watcher" in terminal)
     
2. Ensure ComfyUI is running on your local machine (default: http://localhost:8188)

3. **Open Starmie Panel**:
   - Click the "Starmie" button in GridWorm's top toolbar
   - The panel will slide out from the bottom right corner - click and expand it
   - Connection status shows at the top (green = connected) - if you completed the above steps successfully, Starmie auto-detects the local connection
   - *Click the file directory to specify the output folder you want Gridworm/Starmie to "watch" (defaults to a ~\ComfyUI\selected-output folder)

4. **Import from ComfyUI**:
   - Add and connect the Starmie Universal Node as your image output node (I created several nodes you can try, but this should work in most cases)
   - Images appear instantly in your GridWorm media panel and standard grid
   - There will also be a check every 3 seconds to update any files that are added to the watched folder (manually or via ComfyUI)

5. **Workflow Tips**:
   - **Iterative Design**: Generate variations in ComfyUI, import the best ones to GridWorm
   - **Batch Processing**: Run batch operations in ComfyUI, organize results in GridWorm
   - **Version Control**: Use GridWorm's grid to track different iterations from ComfyUI
   - **Mixed Media**: Combine AI-generated images with your existing media library
   - **Manage Media**: Use export operations to move files locally or delete the ones you do not want individually or as mass actions
   - - TIP: All script operations are stored in the Log tab for ease of review and intended for nondestructive staging. You can run the operations and then copy and paste the commands into terminal at a later time!

     npm run dev
     ```
   - Press Enter

   - OR open your web browser and type `localhost:5174` in the address bar
   - GridWorm should now be running!

### Your First GridWorm Session

1. **Understanding the Interface**:
   - **Media Panel** (left side): Shows all your imported files
   - **Grid Area** (center): Where you organize your media
   - **Controls** (top): Buttons for different features
   - **Dark/Light Mode** (top right): Click the sun/moon icon

2. **Add Your First Media**:
   - Find some image files on your computer (photos, screenshots, etc.)
   - Drag them directly onto the grid
   - OR click the "Upload" button and select files
   - Your images will appear in both the Media Panel and on the grid

3. **Organize Your Grid**:
   - Click "Grid Size" button
   - Use the sliders to change the number of rows and columns
   - Try the preset buttons (3√ó3, 10√ó10, etc.) to quickly resize
   - Drag images from one cell to another to rearrange

4. **Try Grid Edit Mode** (Excel-like features):
   - Click the "Grid Edit" button (looks like a pencil icon)
   - Click on any empty cell and start typing
   - Right-click a cell to change its background color
   - Try adding =SUM(A1:A3) in a cell to see formulas work (you'll have to click away from the active cell to see it update)
   - Mix text labels with your images for organization
   - Click "Exit Edit Mode" when done

6. **Work with PDFs**:
   - Drag a PDF file onto the grid
   - With preview mode on (eye icon), click the PDF
   - Choose "Extract All Pages" to convert the PDF to individual page images
   - Or select specific pages to extract
   - Each page becomes a separate image in your grid

   - **3D Book View**: Click the book icon to see your grid as a 3D book
   - **Free Grid**: Switch to free grid mode for creative layouts
   - **Save Your Work**: Click "Save Project" to save your arrangement

8. **Performance Check** (Recommended for first time):
   - Click the gauge icon in the grid controls
   - This tests your computer's capability
   - It will recommend the best grid size for smooth performance

### Stopping GridWorm

When you're done:
1. Go back to the terminal/command prompt window
2. Press `Ctrl + C` (on both Windows and Mac)
3. Type `Y` if it asks to terminate
4. Close the terminal window
5. Close the browser tab

### Next Time You Use GridWorm

1. Open the terminal in the GridWorm folder (same as step 2 in Installation)
2. Type `npm run dev` and press Enter
3. Open your browser to `localhost:5174`

### Pro Tips for Beginners

- **Start Small**: Begin with a 3√ó3 or 4√ó3 grid until you're comfortable
- **Use Grid Lock**: The lock button prevents accidental rearrangement
- **Save Often**: Create projects or save to bookshelf to save your arrangements
- **Missing Files Are OK**: If you move files, GridWorm shows placeholders - just re-add the files
- **Experiment**: Try all the buttons - you can't break anything!

### Troubleshooting

**"npm is not recognized"**: Node.js isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling from step 1.

**"Port 5174 is already in use"**: GridWorm is already running. Check your browser for an open tab.

**Images won't load**: Make sure your image files are in common formats (JPG, PNG, GIF).

**Everything is slow**: Run the performance test (gauge icon) and use a smaller grid size.
